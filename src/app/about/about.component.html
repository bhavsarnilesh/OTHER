        <mat-list-item role="listitem"> Ultraviolet light (UV) is a type of naturally present electromagnetic radiation that is in sunlight and actually makes up approximately 10% of the total light generated by the sun. UV light is electromagnetic energy with wavelengths shorter than visible light but longer than x-rays. </mat-list-item><br/>
        <mat-list-item role="listitem">The wavelength of this light ranges from 10nm to 400nm and is classified into three sub-bands; UV-A (near), UV-B (middle), and UV-C (far).</mat-list-item><br/>

          “On the UV light spectrum, there are UV-A, B and C lights. Only the UV-C light can kill germs,”

          Exposure to UV-C light of 254 nm for a period of 10 minutes was found to deactivate the virus, in comparison to other wavelengths of UV light.

            Given this effectiveness of deactivating viruses and bacteria, many companies are building devices that use UV-C light to sanitize spaces. In New York, the government is sanitizing buses and trains at depots using UV lights.

            Hospitals plan to install UV-C lights at ceiling height and install fans that draw up air from below to that height to destroy viruses and bacteria. Other companies are making boxes and cupboards with UV-C light in them to sanitize personal protective equipment and other items.

            However, using UV-C is only one option. Given that it needs at least 10 minutes of exposure to be effective, it is just one solution for spaces that are static. Other methods of disinfection will have to be used in conjunction with other methods of disinfection.
